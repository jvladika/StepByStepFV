The COVID-19 virus can impact the white blood cells in the body by causing an increase in the white blood cell count, particularly elevated lymphocytes, as the body responds to the infection, even in asymptomatic individuals. The disease may also lead to alterations in white blood cells.  Autoimmune diseases can make individuals more susceptible to COVID-19 due to an altered immune response, which can affect their ability to fight off infections effectively. The relationship between autoimmune diseases and COVID-19 is complex, as the conditions are interconnected in this context.  Treatments for autoimmune diseases that modulate the immune response may help the body in its fight against COVID-19, since both conditions involve active immune reactions and the potential for autoantibody production; therefore, regulating the immune system could potentially reduce the severity of COVID-19.

This applies when it is part of the virus, when it is free but of viral origin, and when it is produced in ribosomes by the mRNA of the mRNA and adenovectorDNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n2. The spike protein is located on the outside of a coronavirus and is how SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus) enters human cells.

The mRNA in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines contains instructions for cells to produce the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, thereby leading to the production of spike protein.  The body's immune response to the spike protein from mRNA vaccines has the potential to cause myocarditis in genetically predisposed individuals or those with certain hormonal influences, such as higher testosterone levels in males, as the immune response to the spike protein may trigger inflammation in the heart muscle.  Myocarditis or pericarditis can occur after mRNA vaccination, possibly due to an overactive immune response in genetically predisposed individuals or hormonal factors. Furthermore, myocarditis has been observed in response to other vaccines, suggesting that the immune response to the spike protein or its components could also play a role. The exact mechanisms linking the spike protein to myocarditis are still being investigated, including the potential for allergic reactions to trigger inflammation in the heart muscle.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can directly infect the arteries of the heart and cause the fatty plaque inside arteries to become highly inflamed, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n3. The most commonly reported long-term effects of COVID-19 include shortness of breath, fatigue and joint pain. More serious long-term complications, such as myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, appear to be uncommon following COVID-19. \"COVID-19 doesn't usually affect the heart,\" says Dr. Leslie Cooper, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.\n4. COVID-19-related inflammation raises the risk of this type of heart attack by activating the body's clotting system and disrupting the blood vessel lining. When inflamed, this lining loses its ability to resist clot formation. These blood clots in the large and small arteries of the heart cut off its supply of oxygen.\n5.

This conclusion is based on the increased risk of dangerous blood clots found in people who had contracted COVID-19 for nearly a year after infection, as indicated in Evidence 4.  The specific vaccines referred to regarding the rare type of blood clot are the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, as per the given answer.

In 2012, those services cost nearly $220 billion, or 9 percent of all health spending; of this, 61 percent was paid by Medicaid, the public safety‐net program for the poor; 22 percent was out of pocket; and only 13 percent was covered by private insurance and other public sources (O ...\n3. Abstract. Private insurance coverage for economic losses caused by pandemics is limited. While many factors contribute to reduced demand and supply, we attribute the low amount of coverage to the high levels of capital that would be required to credibly insure pandemic economic losses with cross-sectional pooling mechanisms.\n4. For many uninsured people, the costs of health insurance and medical care are weighed against equally essential needs, like housing, food, and transportation to work, and many uninsured adults ...\n5.

Treatment for Long COVID involves managing individual symptoms and may require a multidisciplinary approach, as there is currently no specific treatment for the condition itself.  PANS and PANDAS are recognized differently from long COVID, with PANS/PANDAS being identified by a sudden onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms, potentially linked to infections like streptococcus, while long COVID is recognized by the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms or new symptoms appearing weeks after the initial infection.  The answer states that PANS/PANDAS is recognized in children based on the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and other neuropsychiatric manifestations following a streptococcal infection, and its treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and sometimes immunomodulatory therapies. In contrast, long COVID treatment primarily focuses on managing specific symptoms and may include medications, rehabilitation, and lifestyle modifications.

Air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms. While most people recover from pneumonia without any lasting lung damage, the pneumonia associated with COVID-19 can be severe.\n3. COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person's immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fevers, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure.\n4.

UVC light, particularly in the range of 200-300 nm with a peak effectiveness at 260 nm, is specifically germicidal and has been shown to effectively inactivate viruses, including SARS-CoV-, while sunlight's effectiveness is influenced by its UVC content which is relatively low and other factors such as weather and atmospheric conditions.

The reactivation of herpesviruses (HHV) in COVID-19 patients is evident in the literature. Several reports have been published regarding the reactivation of these viruses (HSV, VZV, EBV, and CMV) among those who got COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we aimed to review the current evidence to assess whether HHVs reactivation has any association with the prior administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n3. These examples suffice to show that after COVID-19 vaccine administration, reactivation of the herpes virus family may occur. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that, although vaccines are critical for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine administration could lead to the reactivation of the herpes virus family.\n4. Results of Clinical Studies Reporting on HSV-1 Reactivation in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19.

Background Certain clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mimic those associated with human herpesvirus (HHV) infection. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of herpesvirus in patients with COVID-19 and determined if coinfection is associated with poorer outcomes and neurological symptoms.\n3. The herpes viruses are responsible for significant neurological morbidity. Three of the 8 human herpes virus types—herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, and varicella zoster virus—establish latency in the peripheral sensory ganglia and persist in the host for a lifetime.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) establishes a latent infection in peripheral neurons and can periodically reactivate to cause disease. Reactivation can be triggered by a variety of stimuli that can activate different cellular processes to result in increased HSV lytic gene expression and production of infectious virus.\n3. Herpes simplex virus. HSV-1 is primarily associated with blisters, referred to as cold sores, or herpes labialis, on the lips. The HSV-2 is associated with related genital sores or blisters; however, both viruses can cause lesions at either site. In fact, the HSV-1 is today the most common form found in genital herpes .

Although originally thought to be a Th2-driven inflammatory response to inhaled innocuous allergen, the immune response in asthma is now considered highly heterogeneous.\n3. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning.\n4. Type 2 inflammation is a systemic allergic response that involves the activation of immune cells, including eosinophils, mast cells and T-cells.

Metastasis is the most dangerous stage in the development of malignant tumors, and approximately 60% of the deaths in patients with solid tumors are caused by metastasis [1, 2].Platelets are the smallest circulating blood cell components, and their main function is to participate in the processes of coagulation, hemostasis, and thrombosis upon vascular or tissue injury.\n5. The platelets influence several aspects of cancer biology, including cancer growth and metastasis, immune evasion, tumor angiogenesis, and sometimes the slowing of tumor growth. The platelets exert their influence in a variety of ways, which are discussed extensively in the reviews. Tumors, in turn, can also affect the number, behavior, and ...",

The evidence suggests that severe COVID-19 illness can lead to organ damage.  The cytokine response to COVID-induced inflammation can cause changes in motor activity and motivation, and increase anxiety, arousal, and alarm, due to the impact of cytokines on neurocircuits in the brain, including the basal ganglia and anterior cingulate cortex, which are important for regulating motor function.  The cytokine response in individuals with COVID-induced inflammation can affect emotional states like anxiety and arousal, as the activation of peripheral inflammatory responses caused by COVID-19 has been associated with mood and anxiety disorders, partly due to alterations in neurotransmitter function and impacts on neurocircuits in the brain.  In individuals with non-communicable diseases, the body's cytokine response to COVID-19 contributes to the development of lung inflammation due to an abnormal immune landscape characterized by an overactivated inflammatory response and an impaired adaptive immune response to the virus.

Common ones include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Autoimmune diseases can affect many types of tissues and nearly any organ in your body. They may cause a variety of symptoms including pain, tiredness (fatigue), rashes, nausea, headaches, dizziness and more.\n3. Called autoimmune disease, these attacks can affect any part of the body, weakening bodily function and even turning life-threatening. Scientists know about more than 80 autoimmune diseases.

Here's a summary of the evidence:  **Mechanism of transmission:** COVID-19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets that are generated when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can land on surfaces or be inhaled by others nearby.  **How masks work:** Masks can reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by:  1. **Reducing the emission of respiratory droplets**: Masks can decrease the number of droplets that are released into the air when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. 2. **Filtering out droplets**: Masks can filter out some of the droplets that are released, reducing the amount of virus that is expelled into the air. 3. **Preventing inhalation**: Masks can also prevent the inhalation of droplets that contain the virus, reducing the risk of infection.  **Evidence from studies:**  1. **A systematic review and meta-analysis** published in The Lancet in 2020 found that mask-wearing was associated with a significant reduction in the transmission of COVID-19.

Our lungs, trachea, bronchi, and diaphragm work together to bring oxygen into the body and remove carbon dioxide. 3. **Oxygen saturation**: Studies have shown that oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) remain relatively consistent when breathing without a mask, as long as the air quality is good. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that SpO2 levels were similar in healthy individuals breathing room air with or without a mask.

This can lead to a decrease in oxygen intake and an increase in carbon dioxide levels (3, 4). 3. **CO2 rebreathing**: When you exhale, some of the carbon dioxide is trapped inside the mask and can be rebreathed, which can lead to a buildup of CO2 in the blood.

Estrogen, in particular, plays a role in muscle function and strength (1). Studies have shown that changes in estrogen levels can impact muscle strength, power, and endurance (2). 2. **Muscle fiber composition:** Research suggests that COCP use may alter muscle fiber composition, leading to a shift from fast-twitch (FT) to slow-twitch (ST) fibers (3). FT fibers are responsible for generating rapid, powerful contractions, while ST fibers are more efficient for endurance activities. This shift may result in decreased muscle strength. 3. **Muscle damage and inflammation:** COCP use has been linked to increased muscle damage and inflammation",

The therapy is based on the principle that light, at specific wavelengths and intensities, can interact with cells and biological tissues, leading to various physiological responses.  The effects of LLLT/PBM are thought to be mediated by the absorption of light by chromophores, such as cytochrome c oxidase, in cells. This absorption leads to increased ATP production, modulation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in various biological responses, including:  1. Increased collagen synthesis and tissue repair 2. Enhanced wound healing 3. Reduced inflammation and pain 4. Improved tissue oxygenation 5. Modulation of the immune response  Evidence supporting the effectiveness of LLLT/PBM comes from numerous studies across various fields, including:  1. **Wound healing**: A 2018 systematic review of 15 studies on LLLT for wound healing found that it significantly improved wound closure rates and reduced healing time (1). 2. **Pain relief**: A 2019 meta-analysis",

It is one of the two most well-known compounds in cannabis, the other being THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is the primary psychoactive compound responsible for the \"high\" associated with marijuana use.  Here's some evidence to support this definition:  **Chemical Structure:** CBD is a phytocannabinoid, a type of compound found in the cannabis plant. Its chemical structure is C21H30O2, and it is classified as a cannabinoid, a class of compounds that interact with the body's endocannabinoid system. (Source: National Center for Biotechnology Information, PubChem)  **Non-Psychoactive:** Unlike THC, CBD does not produce a psychoactive effect or a \"high\" when consumed. This is because it does not bind to the CB1 receptor in the brain, which is responsible for the psychoactive effects of THC. (Source: National Institute on Drug Abuse, \"Cannabidiol (CBD)\")  **Therapeutic Effects:** CBD has been shown to have a range of therapeutic effects, including:  * Reducing inflammation and pain (Source: Journal of Experimental Medicine, \"",

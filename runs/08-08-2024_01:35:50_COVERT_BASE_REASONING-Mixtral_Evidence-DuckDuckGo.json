Various pathogens, autoimmune and malignant diseases, but also genetic disorders and certain therapeutic interventions, can lead to life-threatening systemic inflammatory syndromes in the human body. Their common feature is a massive release of cytokines due to excessive activation of immune cells.\n4. A critical evaluation of the term cytokine storm and its relevance to COVID-19 is warranted. Cytokine storm has no definition. Broadly speaking, it denotes a hyperactive immune response characterized by the release of interferons, interleukins, tumor-necrosis factors, chemokines, and several other mediators.\n5. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce cell death in various cell types, leading to pathological conditions. In a study conducted on 416 patients affected with COVID-19, cardiac injury was present in about 19.7% during hospitalization of the patients [].There is a possibility that COVID-19 causes myocardial cell injury either directly by interacting with the angiotensin-converting ...",

As if the breathing complications associated with COVID-19 aren't worrisome enough, doctors are discovering another risk posed by the coronavirus: blood clots that can lead to life-threatening strokes, heart attacks and pulmonary embolism..

It often damages the brain's autonomic nervous system, leading to abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, the virus that causes COVID can infect and injure the linings of blood vessels and make blood clot more easily.

Vaccines help the body learn how to defend itself from disease without the dangers of a full-blown infection. The immune response to a vaccine might cause tiredness and discomfort for a day or two, but the resulting protection can last a lifetime. Infections are unpredictable and can have long-term consequences.\n3. We know that fully vaccinated people still have good immunity after a year—and probably longer. Why is it that the vaccine leads to better immunity than natural infection? The honest truth is, we don't know. The immune system of people who have been infected has been trained to target all these different parts of the virus called antigens.\n4. A better immune response. Vaccines have other advantages over natural infections. For one, they can be designed to focus the immune system against specific antigens that elicit better responses.

Fatigue, brain fog, and post-exertional malaise (PEM) are commonly reported symptoms, but more than 200 Long COVID symptoms have been identified. Other commonly reported symptoms (not a comprehensive list): General symptoms. Tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life. Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental effort.\n3. Long COVID can include a wide range of ongoing symptoms and conditions that can last weeks, months, or even years after COVID-19 illness. Anyone who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, can experience Long COVID, including children. COVID-19 vaccination is the best available tool to prevent Long COVID.\n4. Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long-term illness. But the virus that causes COVID-19 has only been studied since it began to spread in 2019. So, research into the specific effects of long-term COVID-19 symptoms continues. Researchers do think that post-COVID-19 syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity.\n5. Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID 19: Trouble breathing. Persistent pain or pressure in the chest. New confusion. Inability to wake or stay awake. Depending on skin tone, lips, nail beds and skin may appear pale, gray, or blue. If someone is showing any of these signs, call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility.",

Moderna vaccine: Immunity starts to develop about 14 days after the first shot. It's fully effective 2 weeks after the second dose.\n2. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it can take a few weeks for your body to build up antibodies and maximize Covid-19 protection after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. That's why wearing masks, social distancing, practicing hand hygiene and avoiding large gatherings remain essential after getting vaccinated.\n3. Among the people who received the vaccine during clinical trials, after 28 days no one who contracted COVID-19 was hospitalized or died. 2. You need both doses of the two-dose vaccines to achieve immunity. Scientific studies suggest that taking two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is very important for achieving the antibody ...\n4.

A COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild side effects after the first or second dose. Pain and swelling where people got the shot is a common side effect. That area also may look reddish on white skin.",

Lungs interact directly with the environment and their primary function is affected by several inflammatory responses caused by allergens, inflammatory mediators, and pathogens, eventually leading to disease. The immune architecture of the lung consists of an extensive network of innate immune cells, which induce ...\n2. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body generates an immune response against itself. Some people with rheumatic or autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, develop an autoimmune lung disease. Marked by lung inflammation and possible scarring, it's easier to treat if detected early.\n3. The pulmonary residential epithelial cells, ILCs, and AMs along with other pulmonary immune cells, are essential to maintain the steady-state in the lungs. However, their ability to recognize different airway pathogens and allergens also induces inflammatory changes in the lungs.\n4. Over time, chronic lung inflammation can change the thickness, composition, or volume of the airways, leading to a condition known as bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is a long-term, progressive condition in which the airways become permanently widened, leading to a build-up of mucus in the lungs and an increased risk of infection.\n5. A delicate balance between inflammation and anti-inflammation is essential for lung homeostasis. A full understanding of the underlying mechanisms is vital in the treatment of patients with lung inflammation.

The unprecedented public health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been met with an equally unprecedented scientific response.

All of the participants will be age 55 to 90 and experiencing mild cognitive decline - people most at risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n4. Since smoking is a modifiable risk factor, smoking cessation is of potential benefit to brain health. The increased risk of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, is linked with current smoking, and smoking cessation is a risk reducer. There are many effective approaches to smoking cessation.\n5. 2.

The postwar economy proved to be more robust, which encouraged families to have more children. During the 1940s, particularly in the time after the end of World War II, the population saw an increase of 19 million. The dramatic increase in the U.S. population after the war can be attributed to several factors.\n4. In the UK, the post Second World War surge in births was confined to a sharp spike in 1946, after which the number of births dropped again. Then the post-World War babies started having their babies, giving rise to the births that can be seen across the 1960s.\n5.

Americans experienced COVID-19 in starkly different ways across regions and communities.

The vaccine protects against three diseases: measles, mumps, and rubella. CDC recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Teens and adults should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination.\n3. Key points. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are recommended by doctors as the best way to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. Children may get 2 doses of MMRV vaccine instead. MMR & MMRV vaccines usually protect people for life against measles and rubella; but immunity against mumps may decrease over time.\n4. The MMR vaccine has made measles, mumps and rubella much less common in the U.S. Most people who receive the MMR vaccine are protected for life against measles and rubella. While the vaccine is also effective at protecting against mumps, some people may lose immunity to the disease over time and may need an additional dose during a mumps outbreak.\n5. Measles vaccine protects against becoming infected with measles. Nearly all of those who do not develop immunity after a single dose develop it after a second dose.

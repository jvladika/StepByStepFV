Many vaccines can also prevent transmission, potentially leading to herd protection whereby unvaccinated people are protected from infection by the vaccinated people around them because they have less chance of exposure to the virus. We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n5. 2. COVID-19 vaccines are effective. We have multiple years of experience showing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.However, the strains of virus causing most of the disease change and immunity wanes over time. The changes from last year's vaccines are small, but they help make the vaccine better at targeting the virus strains circulating now and give your immune system a boost."

For those who get them, most side effects go away in a few days. A COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild side effects after the first or second dose. Pain and swelling where people got the shot is a common side effect. That area also may look reddish on white skin.\n4. The side effects are mainly: Arm soreness at the site of the injection (sometimes known as \"COVID arm\") Fatigue. Muscle aches. Headache. Fever and chills. Swollen lymph nodes. The data shows ...\n5. A side effect or reaction isn't necessarily all bad, by the way; it may indicate that the body is building protection against the virus.

Nevertheless, we have previously described that high glucose only promotes inflammation in human vascular cells previously primed with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as the cytokine interleukin (IL)1β.\n3. A Cycle of Inflammation and Blood Glucose Responses. Inflammation is also often associated with stress. Increased cortisol from stress (internal or external) can decrease insulin sensitivity and increase hepatic glucose output. This molecule is endocrinologically active and produces a short-term response to raised blood glucose levels.\n4. To further support this hypothesis, postprandial blood glucose (PBG) levels are more predictive for CVD than HbA1c levels.

Fourth, relying on ICD-10-CM codes to identify underlying medical conditions may have underestimated their prevalence. For example, obesity was ...\n4. Underlying health conditions, such as heart or lung disease, can increase your risk of developing dangerous symptoms if you become infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). ___________________ Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms can vary widely. Some people have no symptoms at all, while others become so sick that they eventually need mechanical assistance to breathe. […]\n5. Chronic illnesses—including hypertension, respiratory disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and cancer—are considered underlying conditions that may put people at greater risk for severe disease and death if they are infected with COVID-19. The same is true for individuals taking immunosuppressive medications, such as transplant patients, as ..."

But for some, COVID-19 can be a serious illness. Some people may need care in the hospital, treatment in the intensive care unit and the need for breathing help. In some people, severe COVID-19 illness can lead to death.\n4. Two recent studies in the journal Nature provide some of the most-detailed analyses yet about the effects on the human body of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 [1,2]. The research shows that in people with advanced infections, SARS-CoV-2 often unleashes a devastating series of host events in the lungs prior to death.\n5. Izar's team found that the lungs of people who died of COVID-19 were filled with immune cells called macrophages. While macrophages normally help to fight an infectious virus, they seemed in this case to produce a vicious cycle of severe inflammation that further damaged lung tissue. The researchers also discovered that the macrophages ..."

The coronavirus damages both the wall and lining cells of the alveolus as well as the capillaries. The debris that accumulates because of all of that damage lines the wall of the ...\n5. Death can result from cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke and acute coronary syndrome), severe uncontrolled immune response (cytokine storm), damage of the brain stem, or respiratory failure (Wu et al. 2021; Solomon 2021). Respiratory failure is one of the major causes of COVID-19 induced mortalities."

In this review, we evaluate the published evidence in this area, to summarise the impact of COVID-19 infection on pulmonary function and relate this to the clinico-radiological findings and disease severity. Current Opinion in Physiology 2021, 21 :29-35. This review comes from a themed issue on Physiology of the diseased lung.\n2. In this review, we narrate the progress made since the commencement of the pandemic regarding the knowledge on COVID-19 mechanisms in the human body, including virus-host interactions, pulmonary and other systemic manifestations, immunological dysregulations, complications, host-specific vulnerability, and long-term health consequences in the ...\n3. As the virus enters the body, it infects the cells of the respiratory system, including the nose, windpipe and lungs. It uses these cells to make more copies of itself. In 80% of people, COVID-19 causes mild to moderate illness. In 14-15% of people, the disease is severe enough that these people need to be admitted to the hospital.\n4. The lung is the major target organ of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. Here, we outline the multistep mechanisms of lung epithelial and endothelial injury induced by SARS-CoV-2: direct viral infection, chemokine/cytokine-mediated damage, and immune cell-mediated lung injury. Finally, we discuss the recent progress in terms of antiviral therapeutics as well as the development of ...\n5. The pneumonia that COVID-19 causes tends to take hold in both lungs. Air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms. While most people recover from pneumonia without any lasting lung damage, the pneumonia associated with COVID-19 can be severe."

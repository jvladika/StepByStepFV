The function of the immunological synapse has been a controversial area and confused by different definitions of the immunological synapse (Davis and Dustin 2004).

In support of this premise, the minor allele of FOXO3 SNP rs12212067 (which is in linkage disequilibrium with rs2802292 and could act as a proxy) was associated with a milder clinical course of seemingly unrelated inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis) (Lee et al ., 2013 ).\n4.

The hypothesis that the risk of developing breast cancer in adulthood may be increased by factors that first act in utero—in particular by fetal exposure to higher levels of maternal estrogen—was first proposed in 1990 [].Since then, several observational studies have examined this hypothesis by using birth weight as an index of the effects of intrauterine hormones on fetal ...\n2.
